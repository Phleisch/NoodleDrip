        <h2><u>Overview</u></h2>
        <p>
          Stellar album should have won the grammy for best rap album tbh, pusha
          t has a phenomenal delivery along with plenty of clever one liners
          that contain depth and dimension to them, surprises you with how many
          meanings can be conveyed in such a short series of bars, production on
          point across most of the album, fantastic use of samples but it is
          kanye so that is to almost be expected Reasons for not scoring higher:
          no overarching themes to the album wholistically other than drug
          dealing, no meaning behind the placement of tracks outside of infrared
          being last (kind of due to the album just being a collection of tracks
          and not a “story”), no focus on directing the listener to any form of
          realization across multiple tracks, “epiphany” moments are limited to
          a singular track basis
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2><u>Song by Song</u></h2>
        <h4 class="standout-track" title="Standout Track">
          If You Know You Know
        </h4>
        <p>
          almost 4:44 sounding production, heavy on pitched vocals which is
          classic kanye, almost sounds like a classic jay z track which also
          reflects its calibur, and lyrically excellent, catchy hook, catchy
          track all around
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>
          The Games We Play
        </h4>
        <p>
          slow but elaborate production, definitely not a track that pops but
          its solid, delivery is excellent on the slower beat
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4 class="bad-track" title="Track to Avoid">
          Hard Piano (feat. Rick Ross)
        </h4>
        <p>
          my pick for the worst track off the album, elaborate production but
          not great and largely uninspiring, chorus isn’t great compared to
          chorus from the rest of the album, rick ross verse, while delivered
          well is bland and uninspiring as well
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>
          Come Back Baby
        </h4>
        <p>
          amazing sample, bassline is extremely simple but dope as fuck due to
          its frequency and placement on each lines delivery, fantastic delivery
          “wrists for wrists lets have a glow off brick for brick lets have a
          blow off” “white on white thats the testa black on black thats the
          tesla” “super soak homies”
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>
          Santeria
        </h4>
        <p>
          simple looping beat but the combination of the bass and melody are
          stellar, probably the track with the most mature subject matter but
          even then it devolves into generic drug dealing gang shit by the end
          of it
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>
          What Would Meek Do? (feat. Kanye West)
        </h4>
        <p>
          feature was weak, beats aight, lyrics are meh
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>
          Infrared
        </h4>
        <p>
          unoriginal diss track preying on largely common knowledge at that
          point
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2><u>Summary</u></h2>
        <p>
          Its bricks because bricks of cocaine if u listened to the album and
          didnt get that ur a dumbass
